              Of course, the game is far from perfect as there are numerous
              improvements that can be made from minor bug fixes, like the score
              count persisting through level transitions or quality of life
              updates like rigging and animating the runner model to actually,
              well, run. However, I valued the process of seeing a project to
              completion and learning the basics of Git more than I wanted to

            <b>Description:</b> Pong 2: Jerma Pong is essentially a sequel to
            Pong that is themed around Jerma985 (again), that includes some more
            advanced physics work, basic enemy AI (we're talking extremely
            barebones but more dynamic than just avoiding static obstacles), and
            other more advanced features of Unity. <br /><br />
            This project saw me pore hours and hours into learning new concepts
            and a ridiculous amount of trial and error to get things working how
            I wanted them to. The YouTube video documents the main challenges
            but I used a surprising amount of more advanced code for certain
            functionality. While it may not have been the most efficiently
            executed project, it taught me so much and that was the most
            important outcome
