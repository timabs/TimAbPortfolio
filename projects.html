            <b>Description:</b> FeedJerma is an homage to my favorite content
            creator of all time, Jerma985. A relatively basic runner game, in it
            you traverse a landscape of fanbase inside jokes, collecting
            whoppers along the way for points and completing progressively more
            challenging levels. I used this game to get my bearings with the
            Unity game engine while learning the fundamentals of programming
            using C#.

            <br />
            <span>
              Of course, the game is far from perfect as there are numerous
              improvements that can be made from minor bug fixes, like the score
              count persisting through level transitions or quality of life
              updates like rigging and animating the runner model to actually,
              well, run. However, I valued the process of seeing a project to
              completion and learning the basics of Git more than I wanted to
              listen to that debilitating perfectionism. Finally, I have an

            <b>Description:</b> Pong 2: Jerma Pong is essentially a sequel to
            Pong that is themed around Jerma985 (again), that includes some more
            advanced physics work, basic enemy AI (we're talking extremely
            barebones but more dynamic than just avoiding static obstacles), and
            other more advanced features of Unity. <br /><br />
            This project saw me pore hours and hours into learning new concepts
            and a ridiculous amount of trial and error to get things working how
            I wanted them to. The YouTube video documents the main challenges
            but I used a surprising amount of more advanced code for certain
            functionality. While it may not have been the most efficiently
            executed project, it taught me so much and that was the most
            important outcome

            <b>Description:</b> Browser Stickies started as a really basic,
            run-of-the-mill task manager app where you could add and subtract
            tasks to a relatively pleasing aesthetic backdrop. However, it
            evolved into a lot more. <br /><br />
            It started with wanting to spruce up the design, then adding
            categories, drag-and-drop, and it ended with wanting to persist user
            data (currently, I'm using a cookie but eventually will implement
            more secure auth/login) with a whole lot of small changes and
            features in between. While there definitely is work to be done
            (there's a known-bugs list on the GitHub page), building this webapp
            introduced me to full-stack development and deployment, giving me a
            great framework for the entire process of building a web
            application.

            <b>Description:</b> If you couldn't already tell, Jerma is my
            favorite content creator. This is my third project themed around
            him, why? Well, freeCodeCamp has a project for the responsive web
            design certification that prompts you to create a tribute page for
            someone. I didn't want to risk making something that would
            compromise the privacy of any of my loved ones so I chose a public
            figure. I also took it as an opportunity to play around with some
            different design techniques and patterns, including a navigation
            menu that changes in a more signifcant way whether you're on desktop
            or mobile.<br />

            <b>Description:</b> For yet another responsive web design
            certification project, I was tasked with creating a landing page for
            some sort of product. I took it a bit further and sketched out an
            entire fictional brand. Settling on a luxury line of gaming
            peripherals, I challenged myself to adhere to a style I don't
            usually gravitate toward, in concept but also visually. I ended up
            making one of, in my opinon, my best looking websites that scales
            really well on mobile. There are naturally some tweaks that need to
            be made for different heights and some minor alignment issues, but
            overall, I'm really proud of how Lux Lane turned out!
