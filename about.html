        It started in 2016 (age 16-17) while I was fighting Burkitt's Lymphoma,
        a rare cancer which forced me into eight months of intensive treatment.
        Burned skin, "chemobrain" and malnourishment consumed me at a time when
        I was meant to be preparing for my future. Realistically, all I could do
        was sleep and stare at screens, or maybe play a video game. Technology
        allowed me to stay connected to my friends and the rest of the world as
        well as provide a well-needed distraction. I started college on time, in
        remission, and declared as a comsci major. I didn't graduate that way,
        rather I became a polisci major due to bad experiences damaging my
        perspective on the career outlook. It wasn't until after graduation I
        realized that, while political science was a valuable degree that could
        have taken me to a good law school, I'd be so much happier chasing the
        software engineering fields I still feel so passionate about. So I've
        decided to work my full time day job, come home, and dedicate almost all
        my free time to learning the new skills needed to get to where I want to
        be: making software that's functional, reliable, and pleasant to
        experience. When my day job becomes my dream job and I can afford it, I
        want to set up my mom in a better apartment to thank her for leaving her
        life behind so I might have a better one. I also want to be able to
        support my disabled partner so that she can pursue what she loves
        without fear.
