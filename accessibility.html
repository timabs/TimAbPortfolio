    <p>
      Morse Lane strives to promote an accessible and inclusive community, both
      technologically and socially. We are actively working to make this site as
      accessible for a wide range of disabilities and needs as possible, but it
      is under construction and may still include bugs or features that need
      ironing out. We understand that no disabled person should have to put in
      extra work to access the same resources as others, but if you'd like to
      point out concerns or make requests, we'd love to hear you via email at
      morseylane@gmail.com or using our contact page
      https://www.morselane.com/contact. The end goal of this website is to
      reach full industry-standard accessibility requirements including meeting
      the needs of sensory, mobility and cognitive disabilities.
